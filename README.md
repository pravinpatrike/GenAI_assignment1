# GenAI Exercise 1 : Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
This project demonstrates a basic implementation of sentiment analysis using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The notebook explores data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model evaluation for classifying sentiments in text data.

## Features
- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleaning and tokenizing text data.
- **Feature Extraction**: Using techniques like bag-of-words or TF-IDF.
- **Sentiment Classification**: Building and training machine learning models for sentiment prediction.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of models using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run the notebook, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python (>=3.7)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries: 
  ```
  pandas
  numpy
  sklearn
  matplotlib
  seaborn
  ```

### Running the Notebook
1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Open `Sentiment_Analysis_Excercise1.ipynb`.
3. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate performance.

## Dataset
This project uses a sample dataset for sentiment analysis. The dataset contains text samples labeled with their respective sentiments (e.g., positive, negative, neutral). The dataset is either included in the repository or can be downloaded from [link/dataset source].

## Results
The notebook provides visualizations and metrics for model evaluation, showcasing the effectiveness of various preprocessing and modeling techniques.
